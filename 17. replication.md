> A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. 
  Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments. 
  This section introduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and architecture of replica sets. 
  
> A replica set contains several data bearing nodes and optionally one arbiter node. 
  Of the data bearing nodes, one and only one member is deemed the primary node, while the other nodes are deemed secondary nodes.
  
> The primary node receives all write operations. 
  A replica set can have only one primary capable of confirming writes with { w: "majority" } write concern; 
  although in some circumstances, another mongod instance may transiently believe itself to also be primary. 
  The primary records all changes to its data sets in its operation log, i.e. oplog. seconadry node updated through oplog.
  
  
> The secondaries replicate the primary’s oplog and apply the operations to their data sets such that the secondaries’ 
  data sets reflect the primary’s data set. 
  If the primary is unavailable, an eligible secondary will hold an election to elect itself the new primary.

> When the primary becomes unavailable, an election is held to pick a new primary server from those servers still available. 
  One of the key points to understand is that a majority is required to elect a new primary. 
  Not just a majority from available servers, but a majority from all of the servers in the set.
  You need an arbiter if you have an even number of votes. As an extension to this, at most you should only ever have 1 arbiter.
  
> An arbiter will always be an arbiter whereas a primary may step down and 
  become a secondary and a secondary may become the primary during an election.  
  
  
> Network Splits and Ties
  To understand the other key point it helps if we change our perspective from thinking of servers going down, 
  to thinking in terms of network splits. What?
  You see, when you think of servers crashing, 
  it's reasonable to expect any remaining server to be elected - even without a majority. Instead of servers going down, 
  consider what would happen if the servers all remain operational but can't see each other. 
  Let's look at an example
  Pretend we have 4 servers - representing a [evil] even number of votes: A, B, C and D. AB are in one data center 
  (or availability zone) while CD are in another. Now, the link between the two data-centers dies. What would happen? Each group thinks the other is down and could both elect their own primary. This would cause data conflicts (two servers would be accepting writes).
  So let's introduce an arbiter (E) and with it, an uneven number of votes. 
  Now each servers knows that the set is made up of 5 votes, and thus 3 votes are required to elect a new primary. 
  Whatever group E ends up with (either ABE or CDE) a primary will be elected, and, more importantly, 
  whatever group E doesn't end up with won't be able to elect a primary.
  What happens if AB, CD and E do a three way split? Then there is no majority and thus no primary and the set will go down 
  (but that's much better than having 2 primaries).

> replication
  creating replica of primary data is called secondary data (replica set)
  creating replica on different servers.

>  client can read/write with only primary
   client will not directly communicate with secondary
   client only try to communicate with primary
   secondary data set updates using operations log

>  secondary data set communicate each other
   with heartbeat

>  arbiter : used to pick one of secondary dataset as primary in case of primary data set is down
   aribiter monogodb instance without any data

>  heartbeat : secondary data set communicate each other with heartbeat signal ,make sure they are liveand working

>  replica set elections : 
   to choose new primary in case of primary going down/not accessible to any of secondary
   in this case secondary call for election to become primary.
   all secondary , primary can cast one vote

>  if two secondary data set got equal number
   of votes the ariber will vote to one of secondary to select primary dataset


>  if there is no primary data set, client 
   cannot do read or write operation.


----------------------

> factors / conditions for voting
  secondary/primary data set keep sending heartbeat to know whether they are available or not
  if there is no reply then throuh heartbeat, secondary come to know whether primary is running or not

> uses replication election protocol to pick next primary node

>  member priority(pri/sec)
   to participate, priority must be 1: can call for election(maximum 50 sets in a process including primary/secondary/arbiter)
   max 7 set can voting priority. aribiter + priamary + secondary

>  member priority (0) cannot call for election


> network partition : in case of replica sets gets divided after a linking set/node goes down   
  network 1 | network 2
  arbiter vote will decide next primary
  if network 1 has primary with few secondary
  if netwrok 2 has only secondary with large number
  primary will step down and one of seconary 
  become primary in network 2

> voting and non voting members
  1.voting : can vote
  2.non voting : cannot vote

> a replica set can have total 50 members
  7 : voting members
  43 : non voting members

> members[n].votes -> 1 ,eligible for voting
  in 4, set priority to 1
  voting prio 1
  non voting prio 0
  
>   set state of member should be 
    primary
    secondary
    recovering
    rollback
    arbiter

--------------------------------
> configuring voting and non voting member
  {
    "_id" = <number>,
    "host" = <host name: port>,
    "arbiterOnly"= true/false,
    buildIndex" : true/false,
    "hidden" : true/false,
  "priority" : 0/1(nonvoting/voting),
    "tags" : {}
  },
  "votes" : 0/1	
---------------------------------


> do not modify the number of votes for 
  selecting primary

  votes = 0/1, dont assign more than 1
  which affects election
